# AwesomeDash

## Overview

This project is a user Dashboard.  Open the [project start page](https://cnikolai.github.io/Project1).  Login to create an account.  The Dashboard then displays the current weather and local news to you.  You can click on the places link to get a list of nearby places.  You can click on the ticketmaster link to get a list of nearby events in your area.  

### Problem 
In this game, we wanted to create an advanced platform that used all of our knowledge to date.  We wanted to use HTML, CSS, at least 3 different APIs, AJAX, and firebase.  

### How I solved it
This game uses frontend and backend technology.  

### Technical Approach
We solved this problem using a combination of technologies. We used HTML to create the basic page layout.  We used advanced CSS to style the elements on the page.  We used firebase to store user authentication information and the user's zipcode.  We used a zipcode API to get the user's zip code based on the user's IP address.  We used a Weather API and the NYTimes API to get local waether and news stories, respectively.  We used the places API and the ticketmaster API to get nearby places and to the top 20 nearby events, respectively.  We used AJAX to call all of the APis.  We also used firebase to create a user login.  Because the AJAX calls were coming back asynchronously, we had to use a callback to prevents the AJAX from finishing too early.
